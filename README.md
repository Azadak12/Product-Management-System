**CRUD Operations with ASP.NET Core** <br> <br>
Overview
This project serves as a foundational setup in ASP.NET Core, focusing on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a SQL Server database. The work reflects my initial steps in learning .NET technologies and successfully implementing database integration.

**Setup Required**
1..NET SDK
2.Visual Studio
3.SQL Server
4.Database Configuration

Create and set up your database in SQL Server to match the schema defined in your project.
Use Entity Framework Core for database migrations and schema management.
Optional Tools
Postman: For testing APIs if applicable.
Git: Version control system to manage your source code.

Does not fully meet all the assignment requirements.
Implements CRUD operations for a single table (clients).
Serves as a basic introduction to .NET development by focusing on foundational concepts.
This project demonstrates:

A working setup of ASP.NET Core.
Successful implementation of CRUD operations with a SQL Server database.
Integration of Razor Pages to manage UI.
I consider this project a milestone that enables me to confidently proceed with my .NET and C# journey.

Features
Setup:

Configured an ASP.NET Core project with Razor Pages.
Established a SQL Server database connection using ADO.NET for querying.
CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new clients.
Read: Display a list of clients in a table.
Update: Modify client details.
Delete: Remove a client from the list.
Search and Filter:

Simple search functionality to filter the list of clients by name or email.
Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core: Framework for building web applications.
Razor Pages: For creating server-side UI.
SQL Server: Database to store and manage client information.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>  
cd <repository-folder>  
Configure the database connection string in Index.cshtml.cs:

csharp
Copy code
string connectionString = "Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=myqsl;Integrated Security=True;Trust Server Certificate=True";
Run the migrations or manually create the clients table in SQL Server:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE clients (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Email NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Phone NVARCHAR(20),
    Address NVARCHAR(255)
);
Build and run the application:

bash
Copy code
dotnet build  
dotnet run  
Navigate to:

/clients: Manage clients (list, create, edit, delete).
Learnings and Future Goals
While this project doesn’t fully implement the assignment’s specifications, it showcases:

My ability to set up an ASP.NET Core project from scratch.
Understanding of database CRUD operations with SQL Server.
Next Steps
Using this as a foundation, I plan to:

Deepen my knowledge of .NET and C# development.
Explore Entity Framework Core for advanced database management.
Implement features like many-to-many relationships, tag management, and search functionality in future projects.
This journey has sparked my enthusiasm for .NET, and I look forward to expanding my expertise in the ecosystem.

Acknowledgments
